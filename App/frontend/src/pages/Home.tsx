        Hi, I'm Sai Charan Kottapally
Full Stack Developer | Problem Solver | Tech Enthusiast
I love creating clean, modern, and responsive web apps using React, Node.js, and Express. Passionate about building scalable backend systems and sleek frontend UIs.

        I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer who enjoys turning ideas into scalable and visually appealing digital solutions. With a strong command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Express,

I build responsive, high-performance web applications that balance clean design with robust functionality.

On the frontend, I focus on crafting smooth, engaging user interfaces with modern frameworks like React, ensuring each component is optimized for both speed and accessibility.

On the backend, I design secure RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, integrate databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and handle authentication, deployment, and cloud storage with tools like Prisma, Passport.js, and Cloudinary.

Beyond coding, I have a deep interest in problem-solving, system architecture, and performance optimization. I enjoy collaborating with teams, following best practices in Git and agile development, and continuously learning new technologies that enhance both user and developer experience.
My goal is to create solutions that not only work flawlessly but also leave a lasting impression — blending creativity, logic, and technology to make meaningful products that people love to use.
